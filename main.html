	  <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.time Complexity shows code efficient</p>
    <p>Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b> Space complexity</b> of the algorithm.when a linear search occure then it show O(n)</p>
